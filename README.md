Objective: To enable user to print shipping label with least number of text entries and using third party address providers to quickly create labels.


Implementation: For the cases where orders are available on Ordere, tha User makes use of Ordero integration and prints all shipping labels. For non-order user, current process required manual entry of customer name, address, rate plan for shipping and shipment details. Our implementation will have subscription from data providers like Axiocm, Dossiershub, etc. Once the data is available, user can enter only the phone numbers of the customer and get complete address automatically filled in for shipping label. Even the shipment details can be kept in system as prefilled data. Hence, printing shipping label will now only require input of (bulk input available for multiple entries) phone number and user is ready to print all shipping lables with one click.


The idea has practical use in all shipping apps of Pitney Bowes.


Currently, we have mocked up demo of the idea and we plan to continue the web API and Android development of the idea even after the campaign is over.
